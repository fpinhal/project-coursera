# Documentation of how I used Copilot
During the development of this project, I used Microsoft Copilot to assist me in creating the skeleton of the Web API and in developing the endpoints for the CRUD operations, as requested in the assignment.

#Documentation of how I used Copilot for debugging and improving the API

In this debugging phase of the project, I used Microsoft Copilot to review and enhance the User Management API. Copilot helped me identify and fix several issues, including:
Input Validation: Copilot pointed out the absence of validation on user data, such as empty names or invalid email formats. Following its suggestions, I added validation logic to the POST and PUT endpoints to ensure only valid data is accepted.
Error Handling: Copilot recommended implementing global exception handling to catch unhandled errors gracefully. I added middleware to handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses instead of crashing the API.
Performance Optimization: Copilot suggested adding pagination support to the GET /users endpoint to prevent performance bottlenecks when retrieving large user lists.
Using Copilot in this phase helped me quickly identify potential bugs and apply fixes, improving the APIâ€™s reliability and performance.
