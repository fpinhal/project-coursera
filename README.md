# Documentation of how I used Copilot
During the development of this project, I used Microsoft Copilot to assist me in creating the skeleton of the Web API and in developing the endpoints for the CRUD operations, as requested in the assignment.

# Documentation of how I used Copilot for debugging and improving the API

In this debugging phase of the project, I used Microsoft Copilot to review and enhance the User Management API. Copilot helped me identify and fix several issues, including:
Input Validation: Copilot pointed out the absence of validation on user data, such as empty names or invalid email formats. Following its suggestions, I added validation logic to the POST and PUT endpoints to ensure only valid data is accepted.
Error Handling: Copilot recommended implementing global exception handling to catch unhandled errors gracefully. I added middleware to handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses instead of crashing the API.
Performance Optimization: Copilot suggested adding pagination support to the GET /users endpoint to prevent performance bottlenecks when retrieving large user lists.
Using Copilot in this phase helped me quickly identify potential bugs and apply fixes, improving the APIâ€™s reliability and performance.

# Middleware Testing

I tested the middleware for logging, error handling, and authentication in the API.

Logging: Checked that the HTTP method, request path, and response status are printed to the console for every request.

Error Handling: Sent invalid requests to confirm the API returns clear error messages without crashing.

Authentication: Verified that only requests with the correct token can access the API, while others receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

All middleware worked as expected, making the API more secure and easier to debug.
